I believe one of the biggest impacts we can have is to introduce and inspire people (of all ages!) to solve our most pressing challenges.

I am always looking for new ways to engage with K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and professional communities, particularly those from underrepresented or disadvantaged groups - please reach out to me if you have ideas!

Some previous outreach activities I have participated in are listed below.

# Engineering Open House

I showed K-12 students from our local community how artificial intelligence can help solve many problems, ranging from computer games to controlling drones and maybe even air taxis!
