Welcome! I am an assistant professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Unviersity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am an affiliate of the University of Illinoisâ€™ <a href="https://csl.illinois.edu/">Coordinated Science Laboratory</a>, <a href="https://autonomy.illinois.edu">Center for Autonomy</a>, <a href="https://stii.illinois.edu/">Smart Transportation Infrastructure Initiative</a>, and <a href="https://appliedresearch.illinois.edu/">Applied Research Institute</a>.

I love biking, skiing, and spending time with my family. I am passionate about advancing research on **autonomy and artifical intelligence**, and teaching students how **computing** can help them as aerospace engineers.

Please see my group's [website](https://tran.aerospace.illinois.edu) for more details on my research!
