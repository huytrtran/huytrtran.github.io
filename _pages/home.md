Welcome! I am an assistant professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Unviersity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I love biking, skiing, and spending time with my family. I am passionate about advancing research on **autonomy and artifical intelligence**, and teaching students how **computing** can help them as aerospace engineers.

Please see my group's [website](tran.aerospace.illinois.edu) for more details on our research!
