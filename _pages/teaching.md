# Teaching Philosophy

Currently, my biggest passion in teaching is showing students the beauty of **computing** and how it can help them solve important engineering problems. I am especially motivated to introduce computing to students who have had limited exposure to it or may feel they don't have the skills or ability to get started.

My current approach to teaching is structured around four principles:
- Excite students by linking concepts with real-world engineering applications
- Provide multiple learning settings that emphasize interaction and independent thinking
- Provide early and personalized feedback
- Introduce skills and tools that have real-world value

My [teaching statement](/assets/pdfs/teaching_statement.pdf) discusses my teaching philosophy in more detail.
